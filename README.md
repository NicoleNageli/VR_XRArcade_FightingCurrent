## Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade
Fighting Current Game<br>
Nicole Nageli
## Project Description
Grapple onto goblin sharks and collect bioluminescent jellyfish while navigating through hydrothermal vents and deep-sea dangers.

## Feature Breakdown
### Grappling Hook: Use the right trigger to grapple onto fish
Estimated Challenge - 5: 1, I have already made a grappling hook but need to fine tune it for this project
### Enemy Activation: Enemies activate when the player gets close
Estimated Challenge - 5: 2, can add a sphere collider that’s a trigger, moving towards the player when activated (never mind, did jellyfish collection score instead)
### Enemy Shoot: Use the left trigger to shoot at enemies
Estimated Challenge - 5: 2, we’ve made a playerShoot feature before
### Moving Infinite Environment:
Estimated Challenge -5:  5
The plan is to have a trigger for prefab tiles and once the player passes past them, to put them in front of the player as a new obstacle. Also, it’s a trench environment, so I need to add walls on the side but not a floor. If the player falls too deep, then they die? Hydrothermal vents are physical obstacles that you need to aim in between to get past, maybe they can erupt randomly. Could make it so the environment can get faster as the player progresses?
## Milestones
### By 11/19 - Create basic moving infinite environment, grappling hook, and physical objects
### By 12/5 - Complete implementation of game with visual elements
